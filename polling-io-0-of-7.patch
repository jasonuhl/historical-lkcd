This patchset adds support for dumping using polling I/O (i.e. with
interrupts disabled), which will allow LKCD to work in situations
where we can't rely on interrupts.  This is based on prior patches
from Mohamed Abbas, which in turn are based on lkdump.

The only low-level drivers I'm including here are the ones I've
personally tested.  However, this code exposes the same API to drivers
as lkdump does, so any driver that works with lkdump will probably
just work with LKCD as well.


[PATCH 1/7] Polling I/O: Userland
	Userland changes for polling I/O support:  Add comments to
	the relevant config files to document the new config flag
	(DUMP_FLAGS_POLL), and load the scsi_dump module when
	needed.

[PATCH 2/7] Polling I/O: Core
	Core support for polling I/O.  This provides the
	infrastructure for polling mode dump types to be registered
	(using an interface compatible with diskdump) and dumped to,
	if the user has set the DUMP_FLAGS_POLL flag.  (If the flag
	is not set, or the dump device doesn't support polling I/O,
	we fall back to a traditional interrupt-driven dump.)

[PATCH 3/7] Polling I/O: SCSI
	Support for dumping to SCSI devices in polling mode.  For
	this to be useful, the low level driver for the desired
	target device needs to provide the necessary entry points
	(.dump_poll, at minimum).

[PATCH 4/7] Polling I/O: qla1280 support
	Polling I/O support for QLogic QLA1280 (Ultra2) and QLA12160
	(Ultra3).

[PATCH 5/7] Polling I/O: qla2xxx support
	Polling I/O support for QLogic ISP2x00.

[PATCH 6/7] Polling I/O: sata_vsc support
	Polling I/O support for Vitesse VSC7174 4 port DPA SATA.

[PATCH 7/7] Polling I/O: fusion support
	Polling I/O support for LSI Logic Fusion MPT.
